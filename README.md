# Python README Components

This repository contains snippits of writing (in Markdown), on various topics relating to various flavours of Python development project. Most of these snippets started life in the README's of past projects. After a while, I often found myself copying-and-pasting these texts from one project to another - a tedious process, which is also prone to selecting out-of-date information.

This repositoy represents my attempt at creating a single up-to-date location for all Python project information, for use with README's and any other supporting documentation. It also represents the current state of my knowledge on Python development project issues.
