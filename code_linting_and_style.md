## Linting Code

We have chosen [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for style guide enforcement and syntax checking. This can be invoked from the command line by running,

```bash
pipenv run flake8 my_package
```

It may also be possible to integrate flake8 with your chosen code editor (e.g. Visual Studio Code).
